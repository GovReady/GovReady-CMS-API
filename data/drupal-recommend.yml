    The Security Review module automates testing for many of the easy-to-make mistakes that 
    render your site insecure. Tests include: Safe file system permissions (protecting 
    against arbitrary code execution); Large amount of database errors (could be sign of 
    SQLi attempts); Responsible Drupal admin permissions (protecting against access 
    misconfiguration); Large amount of failed logins (could be sign of brute-force attempts).
