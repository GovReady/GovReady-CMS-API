    The Security Review module automates testing for many of the easy-to-make mistakes that 
    render your site insecure. Tests include: Safe file system permissions (protecting 
    against arbitrary code execution); Large amount of database errors (could be sign of 
    SQLi attempts); Responsible Drupal admin permissions (protecting against access 
    misconfiguration); Large amount of failed logins (could be sign of brute-force attempts).

    This module scans the currently installed Drupal, contributed modules and themes, 
    re-downloads them and determines if they have been changed. Changes are marked clearly 
    and if the diff module is installed then Hacked! will allow you to see the exact lines 
    that have changed. NOTE: This module does not and will not prevent your site from 
    being "hacked".
